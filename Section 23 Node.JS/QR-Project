# I learned using the npm by implementing it from Git
- had to install the QR-Code npm so it can directly use the right browser once the user scanned the QR Code.
- from this project I have applied my GitHub profile for user to see once its scanned from their mobile device.

## What is this Project about
* This project you can use if you want a user to see your own website portfolio or some goofy image you can implement. 

## Here is the screenshot of the QR-Code
